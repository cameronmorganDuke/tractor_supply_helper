# tractor_supply_helper
Project Overview

This project is designed to assist employees at Tractor Supply by streamlining the process of finding product information. By inputting the name of an item, users can quickly retrieve the SKU, price, and location of the product within the store.

How to Use

To get started, simply run the main.py file and input the name of the item youâ€™re interested in. This version of the project is in beta and currently focuses on the gardening section of the store. For example, you can search for terms like "hose," "grass seed," or "canning" to get the relevant information.

Future Enhancements

In future iterations, I plan to implement a neural network trained to predict the location of products in the store based on their characteristics. This would eliminate the need for a .csv file specific to each store and allow the application to adapt to the unique layout of every Tractor Supply location, making the solution more flexible and scalable.
